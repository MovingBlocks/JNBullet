# TeraBullet (Terasology Version)

TeraBullet is a version of bullet with extensions for direct interactions for voxel worlds. Written for use with Terasology. this is an implementation of bullet wraps around native bullet using SWIG.

# Gradle

## Build Natives
- `./gradlew native_linux_amd64_gcc`
- `./gradlew native_linux_i686_gcc`
- `./gradlew native_linux_windows_amd64_mingw32`
- `./gradlew native_linux_windows_i686_mingw32`

# Building



## CMAKE
* \<toolchain\>
  -  android_armeabi_gcc.cmake
  -  linux_amd64_gcc.cmake
  -  linux_i386_gcc.cmake
  -  linux_windows_amd64_mingw32.cmake
  -  linux_windows_i686_mingw32.cmake
  -  macosx_amd64_clang.cmake
  -  macosx_aarch64_clang.cmake
  -  windows_amd64_msvc.cmake
  -  windows_i386_msvc.cmake


```
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/<toolchain>.cmake
make
```

## linux - linux and windows

To build the natives on linux you need:

- ant - installed on the system to build the natives for the generated wrapper code
- swig - installed on the system to produce both the generated code for the native and java bindings

* linux
  - i686
    1. gcc
    2. gcc-c++
    3. libstdc++.i686
    4. glibc-devel.i686
  - amd64
    1. gcc
    2. gcc-c++
    3. glibc-devel
    4. libstdc++
* windows
  - i686
    1. mingw32-winpthreads
    2. mingw32-winpthreads-static
    3. mingw32-gcc
    4. mingw32-gcc-c++
  - amd64
    1. mingw64-winpthreads
    2. mingw64-winpthreads-static
    3. mingw64-gcc
    4. mingw64-gcc-c++

Then simply run `ant` to generated the binding code between java along with compiling the necessary libraries.


the output is produced under the `native-build` folder and is formatted in this fashion:
`libbullet-[linux,windows]-[i686,amd64].[dll,so]``



To build the java portion of bullet, simply run `./gradlew build`

## OSX

* mac
  - i686
  - amd64
  - aarch64

### System prerequisites

To allow the build to succeed on Macs install the following (potentially in addition to the prep for [JNLua](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/JNLua/blob/master/README.md))

* `brew install swig`
* `brew install cmake`

Be sure to have retrieved the submodule in the repo: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

**Note:** On Mac the `jniHelpers.h` file triggered a compile error. It was then _removed_ along with its sibling `jniHelpers.cpp` and two includes in `mathtypes.h` and `gdxCommon.i` - it did not seem like that was in use, but noting it here for future reference just in case.

To test be sure to make the version in `gradle.properties` unique so you can ensure you use it by updating the corresponding version in Terasology's root `build.gradle` (natives) as well as its `engine/build.gradle` (Java wrapper). Use `./gradlew build zipNatives publishToMavenLocal` to get binaries created locally for JNBullet that Terasology can then read, and make sure to refresh its natives (delete the `natives` directory and rerun `gradlew extractNatives`)
